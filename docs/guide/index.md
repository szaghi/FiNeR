# About FiNeR

**FiNeR** (Fortran INI ParseR and generator) is a pure Fortran 2003+ library for reading and writing [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) configuration files. It provides a single OOP-designed `file_ini` type that handles parsing, generation, and introspection of INI data.

Modern Fortran (2003+) improved string handling considerably, but Fortran still lacks built-in facilities for structured configuration file I/O. FiNeR fills that gap with a clean, user-friendly API — no external C libraries, no format strings, no hand-written parsers.
